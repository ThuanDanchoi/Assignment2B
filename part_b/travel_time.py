    Convert traffic flow (veh/h) and segment length (km) to travel time (seconds).

    The method follows PDF v1.0:
      1. If flow <= capacity_flow, use free-flow speed = speed_limit.
      2. Otherwise, solve the quadratic equation a*s^2 - b*s + flow = 0
         and choose the smaller root for congested speed.
      3. Compute travel time: (distance_km / speed_kmh) * 3600 + delay_s.

    Args:
        flow (float): Traffic flow in vehicles per hour.
        distance_km (float): Length of the segment in kilometers.
        a (float): Quadratic coefficient for congested speed model.
        b (float): Linear coefficient for congested speed model.
        speed_limit (float): Free-flow speed limit in km/h.
        capacity_flow (float): Flow threshold for free-flow condition (veh/h).
        delay_s (float): Fixed delay added to travel time in seconds.

    Returns:
        float: Estimated travel time for the segment in seconds.
